This is our week 9 project for Skill Distillery. Workout Tracker is a persistant web application that utilizes Spring MVC, JPA, MySQL, and HTML/CSS. Workout Tracker allows a logged in user the ability to track their workouts in a calendar view. Users are also able to edit the stats about their workouts such as weight and reps.

## Stumbling Points
We initially attempted to make the workout tracking table of our database use a composite primary key, but did not have enough time to fully implement this concept. As our database grows, this table will become the bottleneck of our application. With a time complexity of n, this could be improved to a time complexity of log(n) by using the table with a composite key. This is because when SQL is searching for only primary keys it uses a b-tree searching method.
